/*
 * acorn_codecache.c — per-index shared-memory SQ8 code cache (M1 read + M2 write)
 *
 * Registry: one named DSM segment ("pg_acorn_cc", PG17 dsm_registry) holds a
 * directory of per-index slots keyed by (dboid, relfilenumber).  Each slot
 * owns a DSA area containing a flat per-block directory: a dsa_pointer array
 * indexed by block number, each pointing to a fixed-stride array of entries
 * indexed by (offno - 1).  An entry holds a seqlock version, heaptid, nbrtid,
 * level, flags, filter_val and the SQ8 scale/offset/code.
 *
 * The flat layout replaces the dshash the design doc sketched: a lookup is
 * two dependent loads with NO partition lock and NO hashing, which matters
 * because the scan does one lookup per discovered neighbor (measured at
 * 60K/dim=128: dshash_find + per-entry dsa pointer chase cost ~0.9 us per
 * discovery and put cache-mode at ~2.5x inline-mode latency; the flat
 * directory is the same access pattern as the inline path's in-page read).
 *
 * Loading is lazy and non-blocking: the first scan that finds a slot EMPTY
 * CASes it to LOADING and walks the index main fork, quantizing every
 * element tuple's fp32 vector with acorn_sq8_encode (the same encoder the
 * inline build uses, so codes are bit-identical to inline codes).  Other
 * scans never wait: while LOADING and on any miss they use the element-page
 * fallback (design G4 — correctness never depends on cache state).  If the
 * pg_acorn.code_cache_size budget is exceeded mid-load the slot becomes
 * PARTIAL: present blocks serve, misses fall back.
 *
 * Locking contract:
 *   - dir->lock (exclusive) protects slot claiming and handle publication,
 *     (shared) handle reads.
 *   - Slot state transitions go through the atomic only: EMPTY -> LOADING by
 *     CAS (single loader), LOADING -> READY|PARTIAL by the loader after a
 *     write barrier.
 *   - slot->wlock (a per-slot LWLock) serializes M2 writers (insert/vacuum)
 *     against each other and against directory/page-array growth.  Readers
 *     take NO lock: they snapshot the block directory and copy each entry
 *     out under its per-entry seqlock (acorn_cc_entry_version), retrying once
 *     then falling back.  Growth publishes a fully-built replacement array
 *     and swaps the owning dsa_pointer atomically, so a lock-free reader
 *     observes either the old or the new array — both internally consistent.
 *
 * M2 caveats (M3):
 *   - Growth (new block index or a page array that must hold a larger offno)
 *     leaks the superseded array within the slot's own DSA until M3 eviction
 *     reclaims the whole slot.  Bounded by the number of growth events, not
 *     by query volume.
 *   - No eviction / LRU / stats SRF yet.  pg_acorn.scan_code_cache still
 *     defaults OFF; M3 flips it after acceptance.

 * Retire + drain (reclaim of superseded growth arrays)
 *
 * RECLAIM SAFETY ARGUMENT (why no reader can dereference freed memory):
 *
 *   A block-directory or page array A is retired by a grower holding wlock,
 *   AFTER slot->blocks (or the page slot in the directory) no longer points
 *   to A.  A is freed only by acorn_cc_drain_retired, which runs under wlock
 *   and only when slot->active_scans == 0.
 *
 *   A reader brackets each scan with an active_scans ref: begin_scan does
 *     active_scans++  ;  (full barrier)  ;  read slot->blocks
 *   and end_scan does active_scans--.  A grower/draining writer does
 *     publish new array (swap pointer)  ;  (full barrier)  ;  read active_scans
 *   The two barriers pair (store-load on active_scans vs blocks):
 *     - If the drainer observes active_scans == 0, then every reader that
 *       could have observed A==slot->blocks has already done active_scans--,
 *       which is sequenced after its last dereference of A.  So no live
 *       reader holds a pointer into A: freeing it is safe.
 *     - If a reader's active_scans++ is NOT yet visible to the drainer, the
 *       drainer sees active_scans > 0 and DEFERS the free; that reader will
 *       be drained on a later pass once it has left.
 *     - A reader whose active_scans++ happens-before the drainer's read of 0
 *       cannot exist (that is the == 0 case).  A reader that increments after
 *       the drainer read 0 performs its slot->blocks load after the swap (by
 *       the barrier pairing) and therefore reads the NEW array, never A.
 *
 *   Mid-scan, a reader only ever moves FORWARD to a newer array (resolve_
 *   blocks / ensure_page refresh from the live slot); it never reverts to a
 *   retired one.  Combined with "freed only at active_scans == 0", a reader
 *   touches only arrays published no earlier than its own begin_scan, none of
 *   which are freed while it scans.  On any doubt the free is deferred, never
 *   forced — the G4 bias.
 *
 * Bounded retire list: if it fills before a drain, growth stops retiring and
 * the array leaks until whole-slot eviction (rare; a soak that never
 * quiesces).  Documented; not a correctness issue.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
