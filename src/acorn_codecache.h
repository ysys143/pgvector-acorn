/*
 * acorn_codecache.h — per-index shared-memory SQ8 code cache (Tier 2)
 *
 * DiskANN-style split for non-inline acorn_hnsw indexes: SQ8 codes for all
 * elements live once in shared memory; index pages keep the TID-only layout.
 * The Tier 2 scan consults the cache at neighbor discovery instead of
 * pinning the neighbor's element page (~20 us/access measured).
 *
 * M1 = read path (load + lock-free lookup).  M2 = write path: aminsert
 * upserts the new element's entry, ambulkdelete invalidates removed TIDs,
 * and a per-entry seqlock makes those mutations safe against the lock-free
 * reader.  The cache is a hint, never an authority: any miss, torn read,
 * stale flag, growth-in-progress, full directory, LOADING slot, or disabled
 * GUC degrades to the element-page read — never to a wrong result (G4).

 * bit-identical to the codes the inline build co-locates.
 *
 * `version` is a seqlock (even = stable, odd = a writer is mid-update).  M2
 * mutates entries in place on insert/vacuum; readers copy the fixed header +
 * code out under the seqlock and retry once on an odd-or-changed version,
 * then fall back to the element-page read.  The writer bumps version to odd
 * before the first field write and back to even (a write barrier between)
 * after the last, so a reader never observes a half-written entry.
