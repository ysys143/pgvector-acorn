# concurrent_cache_evict_scan.spec
# Validates M3 eviction safety under a concurrent scan: a scanner holds an
# acorn_hnsw index scan open (a cursor keeps the per-slot active_scans ref
# raised) while another session force-evicts the SAME index's cache slot.
#
# This is exactly the eviction-vs-reader race the M3 hazard discipline must
# survive: the evictor must NOT free the DSA area while a reader can still
# dereference it.  The scan must complete with correct results regardless of
# when the evict lands; cache state never changes the answer (G4).
