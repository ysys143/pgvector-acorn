-- Operator classes for acorn_hnsw.
--
-- These mirror pgvector's hnsw opclasses exactly (same operators and support
-- functions) but bind them to the acorn_hnsw AM.  Because acorn_hnsw writes
-- pages in pgvector's on-disk format, the shared traversal in acorn_scan.c
-- resolves the distance kernel via index->rd_support[0] = FUNCTION 1 here.
--
-- vector_negative_inner_product / vector_l2_squared_distance / vector_norm /
-- l1_distance are provided by the `vector` extension (required dependency).

CREATE OPERATOR CLASS vector_l2_ops
    DEFAULT FOR TYPE vector USING acorn_hnsw AS

-- Scalar filter opclasses for acorn_hnsw (Tier 2 in-filter ACORN).
--
-- A multi-column acorn_hnsw index (embedding vector_*_ops, attr <scalar>_acorn_ops)
-- lets the planner pass a scalar comparison (e.g. bucket < N) as an indexable
-- ScanKey on the second column; the AM evaluates it against the value stored
-- inline in each node during traversal (no heap fetch).  Strategy numbers follow
-- btree (1=<, 2=<=, 3==, 4=>=, 5=>); FUNCTION 1 is the btree-style 3-way compare.

-- Cross-type comparisons for int4_acorn_ops.
--
-- Drivers using the extended protocol often bind small integer constants as
-- int2 or int8 (psycopg sends Python ints as smallint when they fit).
-- Without family membership for the cross-type operators, a qual like
-- `bucket < $1::smallint` cannot be pushed down as an index cond and the
-- scan silently degrades to the unfiltered post-filter path.  The AM
-- evaluates ScanKeys via the operator's own proc (int42lt etc.), so no C
-- changes are needed.
