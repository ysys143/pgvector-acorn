# pg_acorn

Filterable HNSW for PostgreSQL via the ACORN algorithm.

pgvector's HNSW index cannot be used with WHERE clauses — the planner falls back to a
sequential scan, and even when the index survives, high filter selectivity disconnects the
graph. pg_acorn fixes this.

## The Problem

```sql
-- pgvector today: planner picks seq scan, index ignored
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category = 'shoes'
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ...]' LIMIT 10;

-- CTE workaround: no top-k guarantee, pays cost for 1000 rows to return 10
WITH candidates AS (
  SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[...]' LIMIT 1000
)
SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE category = 'shoes' LIMIT 10;
```

## The Solution: ACORN

ACORN (arxiv 2403.04871) preserves graph connectivity under filters by keeping
filter-failing nodes in the traversal candidate queue while excluding them from results.
top-k is guaranteed regardless of filter selectivity.

Qdrant 1.16, Elastic/Lucene, and Weaviate have shipped ACORN in production. pg_acorn
brings the same to PostgreSQL.

## Two-Tier Architecture

### Tier 1 — Zero migration (existing `USING hnsw` indexes)

Install the extension and existing indexes immediately gain ACORN-1 filtered search via
a `set_rel_pathlist_hook` + `CustomScan`. No index rebuild needed.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_acorn;

-- existing index unchanged
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);

-- planner now selects AcornScan path automatically when WHERE is present
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category = 'shoes'
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[...]' LIMIT 10;
```

Supported pgvector versions: 0.8.x

### Tier 2 — Full ACORN-gamma (`acorn_hnsw` index AM)

A dedicated index access method with M*gamma neighbor storage at build time and correct
`amcostestimate` that accounts for filter selectivity. Independent of pgvector internals.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING acorn_hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64, acorn_gamma = 2);

-- planner selects acorn_hnsw automatically when WHERE is present
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category = 'shoes'
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[...]' LIMIT 10;
```

`acorn_gamma` values:
- `1` — ACORN-1: search-time neighbor expansion only, no build overhead
- `2+` — ACORN-gamma: M*gamma neighbors stored at build time, higher recall

## Installation

```bash
make
make install
psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION pg_acorn"
```

Requires: PostgreSQL 16+, pgvector 0.8.x (for Tier 1)

## Benchmarks

See `bench/` for reproducible benchmarks against pgvector vanilla and Qdrant 1.16.

Scenarios covered:
- A: Filter selectivity sweep (1% – 80%)
- B: Post-filter recall degradation (pgvector CTE workaround)
- C: Incremental insert recall stability
- D: Filter-query correlation adversarial case

## Development

```bash
make installcheck          # SQL regression tests
make isolation-installcheck # concurrent session tests
make unit                  # C unit tests
```

Tests use TDD: SQL files define expected behavior, golden files are populated after
implementation passes.

## Roadmap

- [x] Landscape survey (`docs/filterable-hnsw-landscape.md`)
